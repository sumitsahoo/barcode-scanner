## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Barcode Scanner with ZBar WASM

This project is a barcode scanner application built with React and ZBar WASM. It uses the device's camera to scan barcode and display the decoded information.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Live App

You can try the live version on GitHub pages here: https://sumitsahoo.github.io/barcode-scanner

## üìñ Features

1. PWA app can be installed on any device (on supported browsers)
2. Real-time barcode scanning
3. Start and stop scanning functionality
4. Switch between front and back camera in phones and tablets
5. Toggle flash for night time scanning
6. Display of scanning result in a dialog box with copy option
7. Haptic feedback (Android) on successful scan

## üßê Why this is not a library?

In many scenarios, the user interface (UI) requirements for scanner implementations vary significantly. This diversity in UI needs makes it impractical to encapsulate such functionality within a library, as it would severely limit the ability to customize the UI to meet specific requirements.

## üì¶ Local Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumitsahoo/barcode-scanner.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## üìñ Usage

Start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will open in your default web browser. Click the "Camera" button icon to begin scanning a barcode. The decoded information will be displayed in a dialog box.

## üö¢ Docker

If you are planning on deploying the app to the cloud, you need a Docker image. To build the same use the `Dockerfile` provided. The multi-stage build makes sure the resulting image is smaller in size and only includes the libraries that are needed. Also, the use of non-root user makes it more secure.<br>

Build device default architecture image (arm64 for Apple Silicon SoC & amd64 for Windows/Linux with Intel/AMD SoC):

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t barcode-scanner .
```

For amd64 (Intel & AMD) image (most common and widely supported by cloud):

```bash
docker build --no-cache --platform linux/amd64 -t barcode-scanner .
```

Once the image is built, you can push the same to any cloud provider and use a serverless service to deploy the same easily.

To run the Docker image locally use the below command:

```bash
docker run -it \
-p 8080:8080 \
--name barcode-scanner \
barcode-scanner
```
