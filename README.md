## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Barcode Scanner with ZBar WASM

This project is a barcode scanner application built with React and ZBar WASM. It uses the device's camera to scan barcodes and display the decoded information.

## üìñ Features

Real-time barcode scanning
Start and stop scanning functionality
Display of scanning results in a dialog box

## üì¶ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## üìñ Usage

Start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will open in your default web browser. Click the "Start Scan" button to begin scanning a barcode. The decoded information will be displayed in a dialog box.

üö¢ Docker

If you are planning on deploying the app to the cloud, you need a Docker image. To build the same use the `Dockerfile` provided. The multi-stage build makes sure the resulting image is smaller in size and only includes the libraries that are needed. Also, the use of non-root user makes it more secure.<br>

Build arm64 image (Make sure cloud deployment supports arm64 images):

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t barcode-scanner .
```

For amd64 image (most common and widely supported):

```bash
docker buildx build --no-cache --platform linux/amd64 -t barcode-scanner .
```

Once the image is built, you can push the same to any cloud provider and use a serverless service to deploy the same easily.

To run the Docker image locally use the below command:

```bash
docker run -it \
-p 8080:8080 \
--name barcode-scanner \
barcode-scanner
```
